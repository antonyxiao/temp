Molnupiravir, also known as the COVID pill, is an antiviral agent that works as a ribonucleoside analog that appeared to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Its effectiveness is not specific to only SARS-CoV-2, but also many different viruses in general like the influenza, and the mers virus. What we know about this drug is that it seems to be particularly helpful in reducing the risk of severe disease in certain populations of patients that will be discussed later on, particularly in more of the mild to moderate cases and those who are not pregnant.

overview about Molnupiravir particularly from up to date
it's an oral antiviral agent, it works as a nucleoside analog and there's some evidence that it works against SARS-CoV-2 replication in all prevalent variants, such as the delta variant

On December 23rd, 2021, the U.S FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for Merck's molnupiravir for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 at risk of severe disease for non-pregnant adults.

On March 3rd, 2022, the WHO updated its guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics to include a conditional recommendation on molnupiravir. This is the first oral antiviral drug to be included in the treatment guidelines for COVID-19. As this is a new medicine, there is little safety data. WHO recommends active monitoring for drug safety. Because of these concerns and data gaps, molnupiravir should be provided only to non-severe COVID-19 patients with the highest risk of hospitalization. These are typically people who have not received a COVID-19 vaccination, older people, people with immunodeficiencies and people living with chronic diseases. Children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women should not be given the drug.

Mechanism of Action:
SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause the COVID-19 disease, and one of the particular organs that seems to get really plagued is the lungs, it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome

there's many different types of SARS-CoV-2 variants
the alpha variant the delta variant which is the one that was the variant of concern the big big one
as well as the gamma and the omicron variant 

what we know about the SARS-CoV-2 virus is that particularly utilizes the spike protein to bind to the ace2 receptors on different tissue cells, such as the alveolar cells of the lungs, once it reaches the cell and binds with the receptors, it uses the receptors to shuttle the virus into the cell 

when the virus is inside the cell, it releases its single-stranded RNA into the cell. Once it's inside of the cell the positive sense single stranded RNA gets worked on by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the enzyme works to be able to synthesize more RNA
molecules but it must use the positive sense RNA as a template strand and then it takes the nucleotides in the cytoplsm of the host cell and add on the complementary base to it.

so for example we know that RNA 
a complementary is u
c complementary is g
g complementary c and then
u complementary is a

so our RNA dependent RNA polymerase will hold the positive sense use the nucleotide that's
complementary paired with that now malnupiravir though is the interesting guy
imagine 

it is like a mimic of these nucleotides it's a nucleoside analog a ribonucleoside analog and what i really want you to remember is it can act like c or it can act like u at any point in time so let's pretend for a second here that this was the original sequence of the
viral RNA of that SARS-CoV-2 virus gets in the cell technically a should go with
you but malnutritive can act like you and so it'll complementary base with
that on this negative sense RNA which is going to be the new strand of RNA that we're trying to make
c it's going appropriately with g great g should go with c but guess what
malnupir can act like a c and so it could bind complementary to g and so there we got
these two Molnupiravir of analogs and then we got u its complementary would be a and so that binds
appropriately okay good so we have these errors now kind of like errors if you will with inside of this
negative sense RNA then this negative sense RNA should get made eventually back into a positive
sense RNA which is going to be the progeny this is going to be the result of this RNA we want it to look pretty
much the same if we're replicating RNA we want it to look just like the original well now
this is the monte pirovir now malno pyramid we said originally with the a's it should act like u
and with the g's it should act like a c which means that it should kind of convert back
appropriately so if it was you the best situation for the progeny dna is that it would give you an appropriate a
but guess what it says nah i'm not going to act like you right now
i'm going to act like c and then c since it can act like u or c
it says hey give me a guanine to bind with and so it binds with a g is the g's different from the a's in
this situation yes so this right here is a mutation and a mutation
okay then c c those are the exact same but then let's go to the next part so here's the
next two errors okay with the Molnupiravir originally it was acting like a c to
bind with the g's now if in a perfect world these c should reconvert back into gs if
we utilize these as cs and we take and put on nucleotides they should act like that and give us gs for both of these
which should be the exact same they don't and one of the scenarios so one of the scenarios instead of the c
acting like a g and instead of the c complementary binding of g it says you know what i'm going to act
like a u for one of them and so it does this instead for this point here so you see how this error
here it decides to act like a u this one it does do appropriately and
act like a c so since it acts like a c this one acts like a u this one will
give you an a and this one will give you a g so here is
another error so if you look at the points here where it's different we see that there's an error error error
in this progeny RNA this is mutations that we're going to see from different
from the original original RNA molecule the virus now we took this progeny RNA and replicated
this one doing the same thing we just did imagine how many kind of like mutations
that you'll get every single replication cycle that's the nasty thing about this particular drug is that every single
time you get a mutation in the RNA you have to replicate it again you replicate it again you get more viral
error catastrophe more viral errors leads to tons of mutagenesis
and that mutagenesis will eventually lead to the viruses extinction and that is the basic mechanism of action of
Molnupiravir 

Pharmacology:

all right so we have an idea now of the mechanism of action on monday period of let's talk a little bit about the pharmacology what makes it
different from all these other kind of drugs well really the nice thing about this drug is that it's orally taken
right so you can take this drug orally and so therefore if you can take it orally it can actually be absorbed
across the gastrointestinal tract and when absorbed across the gastrointestinal tract then it'll exert its effects on these different types of
tissue cells right so that's what we know particularly about this drug now that's a pretty cool benefit and one of
the reasons why this may be a cool benefit of the COVID pill is that it's an alteRNAtive you know monoclonal antibodies they kind of can act somewhat
similar to these and different types of antiviral drugs so these kind of some of them run through iv infusions or they
have to be given via some type of iv or injection type of way well these can be oral and so that's kind of an ease of
access when it comes down to it right one of the nice things kind of pharmacokinetic aspects of this drug is that it has a half-life of seven hours
in comparison to some of the other ones like one other drug that we may talk about in the future called ivermectin has a half-life of like 81 to 91 hours
so the half-life is kind of nice for this drug which means that it's kind of like sever seven hour half-life we have to take it about twice a day to get kind
of the therapeutic concentration of it and so what we've seen is the dosing particularly for this drug is anywhere from 400 to 800 milligrams particularly
twice a day for about five days seems to be the dosing regimen one of the interesting things and we'll see if this changes a little bit is that
it's a kind of expensive pill okay so 70 dollars for one pill and you take
twice a day for five days to total about 10 pills so about 700 for a course of this type of particularly this
medication the COVID pill all right so let's look at the second article down in the description box below again go check
that out it's in a google doc we're going to kind of overview kind of look at what we have in our data to support
the mechanism of action of Molnupiravir so this was an interesting kind of article from the austin jouRNAl
pharmacology and therapeutics and again the whole purpose of this was kind of a mini review of drugs that have been
shown particularly oral drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and COVID19 and it's really comparing multiparover and
ivormectin but we can utilize this particularly so let's come down here we're going to talk a little bit about
the mechanism of action i like this table i think it gives a nice little kind of overview and we already kind of talked a little
bit about how monoperev is a ribonucleoside analog so it can kind of act like cytodine or it can act like
uridine and so it can play a role within that complementary base pairing that alters the activity of the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase well how exactly does this ribonucleoside work again well we have here the evidence that shows that
it acts kind of like a substrate for that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and it incorporates the Molnupiravir into the
viral genome problem is though is when you incorporate that in it leads to lots of mutation errors and then as you get
more and more mutations it leads to this viral error catastrophe and eventually the viral becomes extinct and this whole
big thing here is called viral mutagenesis so that's kind of the big thing that we see here with respect to
the mechanism of action of Molnupiravir okay now when we talk about the next
aspect that we also talked about on the whiteboard which was the pharmacology the pharmacology particularly like the
pharmacokinetics the pharmacodynamics we can also get a lot of information about this drug we said that it's one of the
oral antiviral drugs and one of the cool things is that this drug has been used in multiple different types of viruses
that we've studied it in it's worked in mers it's you can actually see it's particularly we've actually been able to use this in
SARS-CoV-2 the pandemic influenza the mers coronavirus but one of the cool
things that we know about this drug in comparison to your monoclonal antibodies is that it's oral so you can actually
take this as a pill it's half life is about seven hours which is pretty good and then the other
thing is we have a dosing regiment that's been shown to be relatively effective which is giving it twice daily
and usually the doses is anywhere from 400 to 800 milligrams and what we've seen with this is that it was able to
show some viral clearance by the rt pcr the nasal swab testing so we know it's oral half-life of seven hours and then
again we have the dosing range and again we can come down here and we have some more evidence to kind of support that
here's our half-life here's the amount of dosage 400-800 milligrams and again
it's oral and we have an idea now of the evidence to support what we're talking about on the white board all right so
now that we've done that we know the mechanism of action we have an overview kind of concept of it the pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics let's
get back to the whiteboard and start talking about the studies that showed some efficacy of this drug all right

Targeted population:

all right so let's talk about the population targeted that who is the particular people that molina perivier the COVID pill would be best for and so
what the studies that we'll talk about in a little bit looked at is that this seems to be best in patients who are
more of the high risk category and what are these high risk categories particularly meaning so people that are
greater than or equal to 60 years of age we've seen higher mortality rates associated with that age range and those have been affected with SARS-CoV-2 virus
or develop COVID obesity so high bmi heart disease particularly hypertension
and then diabetes as well as on the lower end those in immunocompromised state whether that be because you have
cancer whether because you have hiv whether it be because you're on some type of immunosuppressive medication in general
these tend to be the populations that are most particularly affected and at high risk of severe diseases of COVID
okay now the other area that we are particularly we'll talk a little bit about this as to why maybe this is we
still need some more literature to kind of back this up but we also particularly try to make sure that the patients that
are targeted for this particular drug be not pregnant why is there risk of birth
defects abnormalities i think it's too early in the studies to be able to say we might need some more long-term literature but those that are
non-pregnant so obese greater than 60 heart disease diabetes immunocompromised non-pregnant and the next thing is
mild to moderate COVID 19. there's a bunch of different symptoms of COVID but generally these are going to be the
patients that are not hospitalized that seem to be the most beneficial target for this drug so mild to moderate
copenhagen generally in an outpatient setting and they've had symptoms this is a key thing for less than five days
the nice thing about this is that we've seen literature where this can be effective against all the SARS-CoV-2
variants delta being the most ominous type of one 

Efficacy:

all right so let's talk a little bit about the efficacy of this drug so we
have particularly like one study and it looked at about 700 odd patients and we have to have a very specific inclusion
criteria so particularly that we were looking at so those obese greater than or equal to 60 years of age had a
history of heart disease diabetes immunocompromised all the things that we talked about before that seems to be the
area of most high risk for those that could get severe COVID disease so again
these are the actual criteria that we were looking for obese greater than 60 heart disease diabetes immunocompromised
the exclusion criteria is we didn't want anybody who was pregnant okay and we had about 700 odd patients we
randomized those patients into two particular groups one is the Molnupiravir group that's the COVID pill
and then the other placebo group now once we did that we looked at the
study over a very specific period of time and this study was actually stopped early because of the efficacy that it seemed to be such a significant
difference in reduction in hospitalization and death associated with utilizing voluntary vent because
actually in comparison to the placebo that the study was actually stopped early and what we saw out of this study
is when you compared malno piravir to the placebo group with respect to deaths deaths with the mullen empire group was
zero in comparison to the placebo eight hospitalization was the big difference here which is kind of a marker of
mortality severe kind of cases it seemed to be 28
patients in comparison to 53 so it's about a 7.3 percent out of this study
and about 14.1 percent of the placebo study so if you look at the actual reduction in hospitalization compared
molina pirivar and the placebo group it's about a 50 reduction and the p value is about
.0012 that's a significant difference when you're comparing these two
adverse effects wise whether this be due to COVID whether this be actually due to the drug we didn't particularly look at
that was adverse effects for the monopoly monoperovir group was 35
and then specifically for the placebo group was 40 but when you look at those adverse
effects and what do we think that was related to the actual drug 12 percent of that maybe was actually
related to the Molnupiravir for the adverse effects whereas 11 was for the placebo group and then the last question
is how many people actually discontinued multnomah periovere because of the adverse effects related to the drug and
it seemed to be about 1.3 percent in comparison to the placebo which is about 3.4 percent so it seems to have very
little side effects related with the drug as well so we can see a very significant difference when comparing
Molnupiravir to the placebo group now again let's take a look at some of the literature it's not rcts it's actually a
press release in term analysis in phase three but let's take a look at it and see a little bit more about this study
all right so we saw what we talked about on the whiteboard about the the efficacy the study that was involved particularly
again it was not an rct it was a kind of this is a press release that was released by merck and it shows
kind of the study that they performed on particularly the malnu paraveer and the overall kind of results of the study
and we already know that it seems to be pretty effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death by
approximately 50 percent compared to the placebo amount to moderate COVID and
again we can see that here as we kind of look at this abstract portion here we say that the anterior analysis they
stopped the study early because of how effective it was it reduced the risk of hospitalization or test by approximately
50 percent in comparison to the placebo and then the other thing is we want to know our p value look at that p value
that's a very very significant difference within the p value so that's kind of just going to show the efficacy
of this drug all right so now that we've covered that now let us move into the
next part of our discussion which is is there any things that we have to be worried about safety concerns like
oncogenesis or any kind of other things like cytotoxicity let's talk about that on the whiteboard all right so we left

Safety Concerns:

off talking a little bit about some of the adverse effects that we were maybe a little concerned with with taking a drug i think everybody should have that you
should wonder what are some particular bad things that could happen if i do take this drug yeah it seems to be effective at reducing hospitalization
death associated with cover 19 but is there anything that i should be scared of watching out for i should probably
think about before taking this medication and that's always a good question and so some of the safety concerns particularly
again there's no kind of like rct evidence and there doesn't seem to be kind of anything that really really supports this claim but some of the
experts particularly like experts in biochemistry pharmacology virology think that what if there is any concern of
oncogenesis because Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analog could it actually get incorporated into
some of the actual host cells dna like a precursor dna and then if that precursor dna goes and replicates and replicates
and replicates it can produce mutagenesis and those mutations within our host cell's dna can then lead to
oncogenesis formation of cancers or if this is actually in somebody who's pregnant or some type of child
could this produce some type of birth related defects or pregnancy related certain types of negative outcomes and
so that was the question is is there a risk of oncogenesis as well as birth uh
types of abnormalities so there was
a statement from merck and they said that they again they denied that there was any kind of
particular evidence there was a virology expert we'll look at that actual report but they denied
any kind of evidence of oncogenesis but in there they do claim you should try to
avoid those patients who are pregnant and if they are within child-bearing age
they should try to abstain from sex for a certain 28-day period or try to utilize contraception during that time
period and i think that's a good blanket statement in general any kind of like study where you're testing a drug you should try to reduce any risk of
teratogenic effects in general so that's what we know about the questionable concern of oncogenesis associated with
Molnupiravir let's take a look at the cytotoxicity effect so
when we talk about this what is this concern of cytotoxicity the question is is if i take this drug
and yes it should help to kill those cells that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but what if it
what if it doesn't just target these cells what if it targets some of my other healthy normal cells that i want to keep
intact and i don't want them to go and die or develop mutations or dna damage how do i know that this isn't going to
damage my own healthy cells and so that's the question can this destroy all of the cells not just the infected ones
but the non-infected healthy cells and so what they did is there was a study that they did on animals they took some
tracheobronchial tissue cells from some mice we call these the calu3 cells
they took those cells washed them invected them with the sarcophagus virus and then introduced the particular type
of Molnupiravir to see what the concentration that was necessary to be
able to produce a decrease in the virus activity or the viral titers
and then we also said okay what's the concentration that i would need this drug to get to to be able to produce a
general cytotoxic effect on all cells and they did the same exact study with various cells so these are basically
african green monkey cells from the kidney they took that washed them infected them with the virus gave them
the drug and then see what is the concentration necessary to reduce the viral replication but what is the
maximum concentration that i would have to reach to cause damage to all multiple cells and so what did they see within
the study well the concentration that that you would need of the malnour pyruvate to be
able to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 activity by half the ic50 was .8 micromolars and then for
the african green monkey cells it was 0.3 micromolars guess what the cytotoxic concentration that you would need to be
able to reach in order to cause multiple cellular damage not just the virus infected cells you would have to get up
to about 10 micromolars so you could see that it's nowhere near the cytotoxic concentration to be able to produce
damage to multiple different tissue cells so it seems to be relatively safe and then also in the same article they
went on to compare a little bit about rem deservier which is an anti-viral drug that we utilize particularly in the
treatment of COVID and hospitalization hospitalized patients it seems to be in this article in animal
studies it may be superior to rem deserver okay especially in having lower concentrations you actually could have a
lower concentration of the drug and have a superior antiviral profile and what we think is that maybe rem
deserver is not as good in those resistant cases that may be
having where the virus is maybe developing a resistance to the rem deserve this may be a good opportunity to trial something like Molnupiravir or
again the COVID pill let's take a look at some data that helps to be able to support these claims of questionable
safety concerns with respect to oncogenesis and cytotoxicity all right so we talked a little bit about some of
the safety concerns particularly is there a concern for oncogenesis on the whiteboard
so when we talked about this here's kind of the article that was published here
and again it was an article that kind of took from experts again this isn't kind of like any published data so just take
this with a grain of salt but there was particular kind of like virologist and kind of biochemic biochemistry experts
one of them was his name was ron swanstrom and uh he's a professor at the university of north carolina chapel hill
and he was concerned about you know there was a question can malnu piravir be metabolized into some type of
precursor of dna get incorporated into the dnas of the host cell nucleus and then lead
to oncogenesis via mutagenesis within our normal host cells and because in theory and metagenic
drugs can cause birth defects can cause cancer like we talked about and that's why sometimes you'll see that
whenever we looked at the study the study particularly was kind of excluding any females that were pregnant
and if they were going to be involved in this kind of study or take the medications they had to have
contraceptive methods or actually remain abstinent for a certain period of time while on that drug
and so again there is some type of question of that however merck didn't kind of immediately respond to the
request for a comment but in a conference call they said particularly from daria hazuda one of the virologists
said that again there is no evidence of the potential for mutagenicity for this agent she concluded that the
company is very comfortable that the drug will be safe if used as intended and again i think when it comes down to
the fda utilizing this they wouldn't pass something that it was having any kind of mutagenic
potential so that's kind of what we have on the particular safety concerns now let's talk about the next part and again
remember this is within the description box this was 5a the next one that we're going to talk about
that we discussed on the whiteboard was particularly is there any cytotoxic effects so not only can this cause oncogenesis tumors birth defects but can
it kill our healthy cells rather than targeting the viral infected cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus let's go ahead and
take a look at that article 5b all right so let's take a look here at 5b this was the kind of going into
talking about is there any kind of cytotoxic effects that we have to worry about with this drug Molnupiravir can it
target viral infected cells and not some of our healthy normal cells that are not infected and that's kind of the concern
can it damage our cells can it have injury on those healthy cells within our body and so this was a study that looked
at that drug particularly in particular cells human airway epithelial cells from mice and then they also looked at some
african green monkey cells particularly from the kidney and what they did is is whenever they kind
of looked at this study they found that there's a very specific concentration that if you get to this concentration
with Molnupiravir it has the ability to have cytotoxic dna damaging types of effects and damage healthy cells besides
the viral infected cells and what they observe that concentration to be is that this concentration
particularly the cytotoxic concentration the cc50 had to be at least greater than or equal to 10 micromole and so that's
the concentration that we have to try to avoid getting up to all right so what we're going to do is we're going to take
a look at this figure we're kind of going to blow it up and see what this drug concentration was that it
was able to have an inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 but without reaching that actual cytotoxic concentration so let's take a
look and zoom in here on figure one all right so we're taking a look here at this figure one within that article
again 5b and what we see here is this is called the the vero cells this was the african
green monkey kidney cells that we took from them those cells and then actually infected them with the SARS-CoV-2 virus
and then gave them this Molnupiravir to see what their ic50 was basically what's
the concentration of the drug that's needed to be able to inhibit the biological process the infection and
replication of sars-cov2 by half and so we see that the ic50 is nowhere
near the cc50 so it's around 0.3 micro molars that's nowhere near 10 micro
molars so that's a pretty significant difference and so nhc is basically kind of the scientific name for the amount
of piravir if you're kind of worrying about that all right so we see that it's relatively effective it's able to reduce
the viral replication the effect of stars cov2 and the varroa cells without reaching that cytotoxic concentration
and if we come down to the next one which is looking at the percent inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 in calu-3
cells this was those tracheal bronchial cells of the mice we're actually infecting those cells and then giving
the drug to see what the concentration is that can reduce the biological process of that virus by half and so
it's ic50 is 0.08 again nowhere near the cytotoxic concentration
of 10 micromolar or greater and so we see that this drug has a very low
concentration needed to be able to produce the destruction of the viral cells without getting to the concentration that's needed to be able
to harm our normal healthy cells within the body and so that's a pretty cool kind of figure here again do take into
consideration this is animal studies we need more particular types of studies a little bit further to kind of look and
see how this works particularly within human cells but at least we have an idea here now let's talk about the next figure
figure five that kind of just takes a little bit of a deeper dive comparing
rem deservier to Molnupiravir okay let's talk about that in figure five
all right so here we have our figure five within again that article in 5b
and what we're looking at here is we're looking at the infectious virus production basically the viral activity
okay so how much the virus is like the concentration of that viral is viruses particularly viral titers here on the
y-axis and then basically the number of hours post-infection on the x-axis and then
we're looking at three particular things we're looking at the vehicle the thing that needs to you know basically transport the rem deserver or
the Molnupiravir into the particular host cells and then we're looking at room desevere and then we're looking particularly at
the Molnupiravir and what we're looking at is on here you see there's these different color-coded boxes here this is
the concentration of the the drug that we're delivering right or the concentration that's needed to be able
to produce that kind of viral like antiviral activity don't look at the 10 micro moles and
don't even really focus too much on the one micro moles let's look here at the low concentration here of ram deserver
and the low concentration here of Molnupiravir at .1 micromolar of
remdezvir look at the viral activity on the y-axis it still has a lot of viral
activity still at that kind of like low concentration so at a low concentration of rem deserve air you still have again
follow this over to the y axis of pretty high viral titers now it's not like out
of this world but look over here at multnopera it's not like a crazy crazy difference but if
you're looking here at these boxes the point one micromolar here in pink
look at this one the highest one here it's much much lower than
the rem deserver so at a low concentration of Molnupiravir you have more anti-viral activity less viral
titers in comparison to rem deserve so what this study was able to show was
that particularly multi pirovir may have more efficacy than rem desevere at sarsko v2 and in those cases where rem
deserver particularly the sarsko v2 viral uh variants and all the different types of
effects that those have it being resistant to rem deserve molina pirivar may be an alteRNAtive option to those
rem deserve resistant cases in sarsko v2 uh variants okay so we see that effect
here now the other thing i just kind of want to clue your eye towards it the article does talk about it a little bit
but it's it's talking about the total error rate and this goes back to that mechanism of action that we talked about
with particularly the Molnupiravir we know it works by inducing this viral mutagenesis producing tons and tons of
errors within the single-stranded RNA molecules and that leads to different changes within the viral proteins well
here if you look at this it looks at the total error rate as we go up the y-axis and then time on the x-axis and then you
have the concentrations well what we're noticing here is that with even low or higher concentrations
of this small new pyruvate it produces a ton of errors within the viral RNA of
SARS-CoV-2 and then if you look at rem desevere no matter what the concentration is
it produces very little errors within the viral RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
now these two have completely different mechanism of action though so in some ways this kind of comparison isn't a
great comparison for this type of graphic representation and i think that's important to realize
this drug Molnupiravir induces viral mutagenesis remdezavir just works to inhibit the RNA dependent RNA polymerase
from being able to form new RNA molecules so again complete different
mechanism of action so i just take this with a grain of salt this particular type of figure here but again
i think the overall thing to take away from this particular last article 5b is that we see that there's very low risk
of cytotoxic effects with these drugs particularly mullen and pirovir and it has a good efficacy at low
concentrations and it also seems that it may be better than rem deservier
particularly efficacy wise and good at being able to help in those rem deserve resistant SARS-CoV-2 cases all right that
covers all of this data here
